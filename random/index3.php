My Goal in life is to change the world in the most monumental way possible. Steve Jobs is my idol because he was so profound, innovative, and never quit. He created the digital age, he directly revolutionized four separate industries multiple times, which have indirectly changed the way we see the world, how we communicate, and how we live on a daily basis. In short, he truly shaped the future in a way only he saw. He pushed his ideas through the most challenging obstacles imaginable, and led a storybook life of innovation while overcoming those obstacles. He is the most influential person the world has ever seen and he is a huge inspiration to me.

I will never forget the moment I realized I wanted to become more interested in computers while shadowing BT high school. In computer science class, they were doing an Alice Project where a 3D fish would move towards a red or blue gumdrop depending on which was closer. But they did not start until I was introduced to the legendary Mr. Allen, the "Chief Computer Geek" at BT, and not until after he gave a speech about how "Computer Science and life are all about solving a problems". That was when I got hooked to computer science. While in 9th and 10th grade, he became a great friend and mentor. He gave me incredible support as I explored and developed in computer science. He would bring in his drone and fly it around the room, make programs that afflicted pain on penguins specifically, and had a huge box of sour skittles next to his chair. The last time we spoke he told me that while in the hospital, he downloaded my new games and jokingly ridiculed my choice of price tier. His passing in mid-10th grade was devastating to me, but he is the reason I found what I love early in life, computer science. Thank you Mr. Allen :)

		<b>iPhone Apps</b></br>
I released my first app, Speed Square, after months of hard work. However, I started building another game, Beest. After building Beest on Scratch by MIT, I bought a Mac computer off Craigslist in a McDonalds. Once I downloaded XCode, all my focus went into Beest. But as I overcomplicated the game's rules, I put Beest on hold and tried to come up with a new idea. I came up with Speed Square while watching Wheel of Fortune. I was trying to think of a new game idea, and the colors moving continuously on the wheel inspired the colored boxes. Some camp friends gave me an idea to make Spin the Bottle, so I figured "why not" and created my third app. I learned how to use XCode mostly on YouTube, and I loved this project that a ball bounced around the screen and you had to avoid it. After releasing my first 3 Apps, I recreated this project with many new features, which I called Fatty Patty. My most recent app,  #Ultimate Tic Tac Toe was inspired by an Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game that was really popular in school. I built a 2 player mode and an AI into the game after looking into artificial e. All 5 Apps have accumulated over 17,000 downloads.

<b><a href="http://www.weinerfever.com">Weiner Tournament</a></b></br>
At Beth Tfiloh, our signature sports event is  the annual Weiner Basketball Tournament. My friends and I built the first website dedicated to the Weiner Tournament. This site included live scores, live stats, and a radio broadcast for all games in the Hurwitz Gym. We organized a group of student broadcasters and built a backend system for them to input stats and scores live. We received 7,500 page views from all over the world in the first 4 days after the site's release. We created the site  as an outside project but within a day or two, it became Beth Tfiloh's official website for the Weiner Tournament. I received the Special Service Award from BT for my efforts.

<b><a href="http://www.surfboard.cool">Surfboard</a></b></br>
During summer break before senior year, I built Surfboard with the help of my friend Avi. My friend and I came up with the basic idea and he continued to be a huge creative factor in the project. The site was worked on all summer and released just before school. Even though it never got a ton of attention, it was a monumental achievement for a few juniors based on the complexity of the project. On Surfboard, you can collage your life with your own "Storyboards". You can post text and hashtags, pictures, videos, iframes, and even DRAW! You can resize all of your posts and creatively arrange them any way you want. It was an incredible idea and a challengingly fun project to build even though it never gained much attention.

<b>Computer Science</b></br>My biggest passion is computer science. I love that I have the ability to express my creativity in an intellectual and interesting way that can be reached by millions. I have made some small business websites, larger projects like the Weiner Tournament site and Surfboard, and many other fun projects with friends and alone. Some of these smaller projects include an online chess set (www.stevengrutman.com/chess), prime factorization calculator (which can factor any number smaller than about 1,800,000,000,000,000,000 in less than 10 seconds), and my promposal in Junior year to my now ex-girlfriend (www.stevengrutman.com/prom), just to name a few. And on my "Big Tech Projects" page you will find some of the more impressive projects I have worked on, some extremely successful, others a fun learning experience. I have made and strengthened many friendships while bonding over our common interest in computer science. I am the Founding President of my school's Computer Science Innovators Club (CSI). I serve as a teaching assistant to fellow classmates as well as underclassmen, and I help teach some of the underclassmen classes. Most of my knowledge is self taught, and I would consider myself proficient in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript (Jquery API) (AJAX), SQL, and Java. I would consider myself to have a decent/basic understanding of C++, C#, Objective-C, Unity GUI, Python, and Wordpress. I have devoted so much time and effort to learn how to do the most amazing things with computer programming and learn more efficient ways to solve certain problems that arise. Computer Science is what I love to do, and I continue to show my creativity and innovative spirit through my work as a computer scientist.

One of my biggest loves besides computer science is music. I think I can safely say the majority of people like listening to music, but I include it in every aspect of my life. When I am doing school work, I will put my phone on shuffle or listen to some country radio. When I am just relaxing, I will put on some relaxing music, and when I am excited or really happy I will put on some upbeat music I can sing along to. Music can easily define my mood. If I am feeling down, an upbeat song will come on and I feel so much better, or the opposite. I like all kinds of music, but my favorite types of music are Country, Pop, Electro/Dance. I really like music that I feel an emotional connection to due to good memories or it is comforting or that I like the beat or lyrics. Songs like Firework and Mean are empowering and encourage individualism while songs like Cruise (My Favorite Song Ever) and Wagon Wheel by Darius Rucker I like because they are really catchy and have a deeper meaning for me. My favorite 3 artists are Florida Georgia Line, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry. Music has always been a largely influential part of my life.

Camp Airy is where I first discovered my love for company around a campfire. My friends and I would enjoy lying out on a grassy field by a little fire our counselors made,  looking up at the stars, talking about aliens and having other deep conversations. We would discuss the origin of the universe, how space and time work, and more phenomena that  left our brains puzzled and amazed. We would read from the The Book of Questions by Gregory Stock which is filled with hypothetical moral situations and deep intellectual questions. We would share our personal opinions on these thought provoking questions. The Book of Questions opened my mind to what is really important in life, and allowed me to share anything with close friends without the fear of being judged. I look back fondly at these camp memories as being the most powerful and meaningful moments of my life.
</div>	<div class="bigBox2" style="width:550px">Because of my love for campfires, my dad and I built a firepit in our backyard and collect wood and paper trash to burn. I have implemented many of our camp traditions with friends and family around our own firepit and have created new traditions of our own. Along with the meaningful aspects of a campfire, I also have a lot of fun just talking and laughing with friends. A campfire is the best place to bond with people because all distractions, worries, and insecurities disappear when surrounded by the trees and stars. When sitting around a campfire, the simplicity of the environment encourages people to be social and to branch out.
Campfires are where I feel the most content because they provide a simple, friendly, and outdoorsy setting that is incomparable with any other place in the world. Whether I am having fun with friends, watching the flames fan in the dark, enjoying the simplicity of nature, or looking up humbled and inspired by the stars, a campfire is where I feel completely at peace with the world.

Swimming has always been a large part of my life. I started swim team at the JCC when I was 7. I won countless ribbons of all colors and places. For years I would continually get 1st place and 2nd place ribbons only, which boosted my confidence in my swimming ability. This led me to become a founding member of Beth Tfiloh High School's first ever swim team! In our first season we won only a few races and lost all of our meets, but I served as a mentor because I had the most swimming experience on the team at this point. As I grew up however and the competition got more challenging, I focused my attention on a new passion, computer science. This new hobby was based on creativity and intelligence, not on physical ability like swimming. But I still loved to swim because I felt at peace when I swam, it relieved much of my stress. I still swim to work out, and I turned my passion for swimming into a workout routine and a job. I was certified in CPR, Lifeguarding, AED, and First Aid over winter break in 11th grade and began working at the JCC as a lifeguard in the summer 0f 2014. Swimming was where I first got my competitive and hard working attitude that has stuck with me as I grew up.
